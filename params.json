This works on Ubuntu, but I cannot \r\nguarantee it working on other systems.\r\n\r\nFor NodeJS dependencies, just run ```npm install```.\r\n\r\n## Running the tests\r\n\r\n```npm test``` will do it and output results and code coverage information.\r\n\r\n## Running the tmu server\r\n\r\n```npm start``` will start up the server.\r\n\r\n## Contacting Us\r\n\r\nSend @LVCSkunkworkds a message on twitter or create an issue to get a hold of us!\r\n\r\nFollow @LVCSkunkworks, @lvcodesmith, and @punkdgeek to get the latest on ```node-tmu```.\r\n","tagline":"NodeJS based Test Management Utility","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
